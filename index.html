                <p class="description-description">
                    Every year, hundreds of millions of dollars are poured into political campaigns. Both Republicans and Democrats spend heavily on TV ads, each side trying to outdo the other. But in reality, much of the effect cancels out. Think about it: if one side spends $1,000,000 on ads and the other spends the same, plausibly no votes are changed. But we as a nation have burned through $2,000,000.
                </p>
                <p class="description-description">
                    There is a better way. What if the money still cancels out, but was directed somewhere far more impactful? What if the same dollars could instead feed the hungry, clothe those in need, and heal the sick? 
                </p>
                <p class="description-description">
                    This is exactly what the Double Impact project accomplishes. You can pledge money to the party of your choice, but the twist is, if someone pledges money to the opposite party, both contributions "cancel out", and we will send that money to charity that both parties agree to at the end of the month. It's a win-win! Your voice is heard, and those in need get the help they deserve.
