                        <p>It's an unusual yet strictly optimal scheme whereby it becomes possible to channel the "clashing" money sent to opposing political campaigns into neutral charities donors to both parties agree upon. But donors don't want the parties to be equal? The point is that there are two ways to alter the outcome of a campaign: giving money to your side or reducing money going to the other side.</p>

                        <p>If you donate to the side that has less money, any donation you make becomes a 2x donation to charity! So if the Democrats have $1000 and the Republicans have $1100 and you donate $25 to the side of the Democrats, that $25 will also take $25 from the Republican party's coffers. The total money is $2,125. $1025 was submitted on the Democratic side $1100 was submitted on Republican side Thus, $2,050 goes to non-partisan charities. $75 goes to the Republican Party. $0 goes to Democrats, and your $25 donation contributed $50 to charity!</p>
